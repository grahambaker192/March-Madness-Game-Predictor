# March-Madness-Game-Predictor
This simple program utilizes a CSV file record with many previous march madness winners.
Each game is read and team statistics for that team and year are pulled and plugged into a tensorfllow model
which can then be used to predict future march madness games (In this code I used it to predict Mens March Madness Sweet 16 in 2024)
